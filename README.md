# I decided to share this picture with you so you don't have to clone or download the project until you see how the app looks .

# Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Pokedex Flutter application.

# to run this app :

you have to install flutter on your device ,
For help "getting started with Flutter development" check the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


# This is how I used my api :

Uri.https('raw.githubusercontent.com', '/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/master/pokedex.json');

The constructor is being used to create a Uri object with the specified scheme, host, and path.

the scheme is "https", the host is "raw.githubusercontent.com", and the path is "/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/master/pokedex.json".

# to summarize:

the code i have provided earlier is creating a URL for an HTTPS request to retrieve a JSON file containing Pok√©mon data.

# Finally:

creating a pokedex app using DART is much easier than JAVA and KOTLEN.

as you can see i only created two DART files (HOME_SCREEN & POKEMON_DETAILS ) and i added some dependencies on my pubspec.yaml sush as:

cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2

cached_network_image: ^3.0.0

http: ^0.13.5

etc...
